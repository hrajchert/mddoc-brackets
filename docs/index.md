# mdDocBracket

This is a bracket plugin that aims to facilitate the creation of code documents. It's a helper plugin that sits on top of the mdDoc library, which
was created with this purpose.

In this early stage, I'm building this plugin to help in the creation of mdDoc per say both in the fact that I want to be closer
to the documentation as I code, and that is a good client for the library itself.
